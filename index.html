		Though their name may suggest otherwise, The Wombats are not in fact from Australia. They're an English indie rock band that formed in Liverpool in 2003. <br>

		Their three-man lineup has never changed over their two decades of playing. Frontman Matthew Murphy commands the group with his sincere, belting delivery and driving guitar play. Tord Ã˜verland Knudsen lays the band's foundation with killer bass grooves and backing vocals, while Dan Haggis keeps the momentum up with his drumming. <br>

		The Wombats have made a reputation for themselves with their knack for sticky, anthemic hooks paired with creative lyrics exploring the comedy and tragedy of trying (and mostly failing) to find meaningful connection. <br>

		They've released 5 studio albums as of 2022, the first four of which you can get a taste of below. Click to the right of each image below to listen to a sample from the album.
